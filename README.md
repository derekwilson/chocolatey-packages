# chocolatey-packages #

a repo to hold artefacts to publish and support chocolatey packages

typically things that need to be served from a CDN but where we have the artefacts in a private repo

## CDN links ##

Because github has asked that raw links should not be served directly as a resources, there are a number of free CDN services which do allow serving of resources, for example [statically](https://statically.io/convert/)
